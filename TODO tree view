"""
tree can show just a few of the latest.
tree can show everything
tree can show structure - includes only snapshots with no children, no parent, or multiple children

Normal function #2
1. find childless snapshots in reverse age order (youngest first) = column order
2. Parse that list. find youngest parent of all of those
3. Print youngest parent after printing all childless snapshots younger than it
4. Replace youngest parent's child by youngest parent and repeat.

Problem: branches overlap.
Solution
1. Find childless snapshots in reverse age order.
2. Recursively print parents up to and not including one that has several children
3. Go to next childless snapshot
4. Do step 2 for it too.
5. If children quota for the one with several children is reached, print it
6. Do step 2 for it too.
7. etc.

Problem: what if a recent branch attaches to an older point than an older
branch?
