Roadmap in order of planned implementation
   
 refactor
    fstab -> separate file
    AptBtrfsSnapshot has too many methods
 
 list command
    -leave as is
 
 recent command
    -lists only the last few ancestors with package changes
    -optionally indicate the number of ancestors to list
    
 tree view command
    -simple view with just names
    -view with change stats
    -detailed view with all consolidated changes
    
 tag snapshot
    append/replace tag after the date part of the name
    -add tag option to "create" command
    -set_default and rollback should prompt for tag if not given one
    -rollback option -t to specify tag
    
 factor in stuff from Chousuke
    -snapshot frequency throttling
    -snapshot disabling by shell var presence
    
 set_default
    check whether staging already exists and prompt to remove it
 
 used space cleaning
    -command line clean [apt|tmp|crash] option
 
 delete_older_than 
    -to keep tree intact
    - should not delete tagged snapshots
    - nor snapshots with multiple children 
 
 single instance

 update man page
 
Issues/bugs/questions
 
 DpkgHistory calls from AptBtrfsSnapshot.py
    -since date is usually known except when there is no parent link
    - skip? 
    - or see if there are other snapshots without parent links?
    - or prompt for a date
 
 apt-btrfs._parse should? take into account snapshots with no info
    -only to ease the transition
