 DpkgHistory
    -since date is usually known except when there is no parent link
    - skip? 
    - or see if there are other snapshots without parent links?
    - skipping is easier
 
 rollback and setdefault should? prompt for a tag for the abandoned subvolume
 
 apt-btrfs._parse should? take into account snapshots with no info
    -only to ease the transition
