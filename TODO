Roadmap in order of planned implementation
   
 history consolidation
    -change AptHistoryEntry to store data in dictionaries by default
    - rename get() method to _parse()
    - stop __init__ from storing installs, upgrades etc in self
    - use _parse in __init__
    -consolidation
 
 history ought to read /var/log/dpkg.log to find manually installed pkgs
    -and /var/log/dpkg.log.1 etc.
    
 recent apt changes command line option
    -think of a name for that option
    -do it
    
 pickle
    -in create_snapshot and set_default
    -testing
    
 delete_snapshot 
    -should consolidate apt change info, unless there is no parent
    
 list command
    -list only lists the last few ancestors with consolidated detailed changes
    -optionally indicate the number of ancestors to list
    
 tree view command
    -simple view with just names
    -view with change stats
    -detailed view with all consolidated changes
    
 ?(re)name snapshot
    would append/replace after the date part of the name
    
 factor in stuff from Chousuke
    -snapshot frequency throttling & shell var limiting
    
 snapshot cleaning
    -command line clean [apt|tmp|crash] option
