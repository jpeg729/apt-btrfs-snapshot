    -snapshot disabling by shell var presence

Issues/bugs/questions
 
 DpkgHistory calls from AptBtrfsSnapshot.py
    -since date is usually known except when there is no parent link
    - skip? 
    - or see if there are other snapshots without parent links?
    - or prompt for a date
 
 apt-btrfs._parse should? take into account snapshots with no info
    -only to ease the transition
